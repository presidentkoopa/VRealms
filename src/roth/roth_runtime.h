// Realms of the Haunting's level logic, running.
//
// roth_commands is the engine-free SPINE -- it walks and executes chains but has
// no idea what a command DOES. This is the other half: it keeps the level's
// parsed logic alive for the session, binds triggers to the geometry they watch,
// and implements the handlers against the live world.
//
// The decoded opcode set is in ROTH_COMMANDS.md; the door behaviour this drives
// is read from doors.c and cited where it is used.
//
// WHAT A HANDLER IS, IN THE ORIGINAL. Read this before adding one. The 0x30780
// dispatch table (transcribed at platform/boot.c:189-205) splits into two very
// different kinds of entry:
//
//   IMMEDIATE handlers do the thing and return -- 0x2f open a door, 0x17 toggle
//   another command, 0x26 set a flag, 0x3b change map.
//
//   REGISTRARS do not do the thing at all. They allocate an ACTIVE EFFECT
//   record and return; the visible behaviour lives in a separate per-frame TICK
//   handler reached through a second table (0x3088c, boot.c:215-229). Every
//   light, texture, height and sector-move opcode is one of these.
//
// So "implement the lighting opcode" is not one function: it is the active-effect
// pool plus its tick. That machinery is NOT built yet, and the registrar opcodes
// are counted as unimplemented rather than approximated. The load report carries
// a per-opcode census saying which is which.

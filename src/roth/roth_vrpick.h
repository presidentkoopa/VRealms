// THE VR HANDS POINT AND TOUCH (roth_vrpick.cpp has the whole design).
//
// Each hand, every tic in VR: a ray from the index fingertip along the finger,
// classified by the original's cursor rules (roth_runtime.h ClassifyPick), a
// thin beam and a marker coloured by the original's cursor state while the
// hand points, and four gestures that end in the original's own calls:
//   point + dwell         -> examine   (ExaminePick: examine_object_under_cursor)
//   point + index tap     -> use       (Activate: activate_targeted_object's port)
//   fingertip press       -> use
//   grip squeeze in reach -> use
// VR only; the flat game is untouched. A flat test drives it through the
// hand test (roth_vrpicktest, roth_handtest).
//

// owns the game this tic, so the hands neither show a beam nor act.
